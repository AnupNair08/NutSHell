### NutSHell - A common shell program to help you fork. 

NutSHell is a UNIX based shell program that can be used to create and run processes by issuing commands.
Currently suppports all basic commands from the LINUX shell along with added built in commands.

Parser written to handle all cases. Integrate it with the current interface of the shell. IO and piping logic for the parsed command to be handled. Rest looks fine


## TODO:
1. Implement the Shell history (Partially done);
2. Job Control and Process Management (Jobs get saced on the data structures)
3. Piping and IO redirection (Done but need to chain)
4. .dnshrc file. (Ambitious decision)
5. Realloc on necessary calls (Ambitious decision)
