### DNSh - Dead Never SHell

DNSh is a UNIX based shell program that can be used to create and run processes by issuing commands.
Currently suppports all basic commands from the LINUX shell along with added built in commands.

## TODO:
1. Implement the Shell history
2. Job Control and Process Management
3. Piping and IO redirection
4. .dnshrc file.
5. Realloc on necessary calls


History feature working but need to integrate with interception of the arrow keys and render the commands on the screen.
